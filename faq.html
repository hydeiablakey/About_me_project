  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions that Aren't so Frequent:</h2>

  <p><b>Why did you create a FAQ page?</b></p>
  <ul><li>I suppose to answer my own questions that people don't actually ask me. Although in hindsight, I could've added this to the about me section on the <a href="index.html">home</a> page.</li></ul>

  <p><b>Okay, let's start with a question! Why do you like web developing?</b></p>

  <ul><li>Short Answer: I like how versatile web developing is. There are many different ways to create your own website to make it completely unique. Also, as the internet keeps evolving, there are even more things to keep learning about web development. Personally, I like being able to express myself and test the limits of my creativity through developing. </li></ul>

  <p><b>Okay, that makes sense. But what caught your interest in web development anyway?</b></p>
  <ul><li>Well when I was younger and had way more free time on my hands, I'd spend a lot of time on social media. I liked how people could create their own profile layouts and decided on creating one of my own. I started by incoportating an Iframe into my webpage layouts and then designing my layout through photoshop. They weren't the best designed layouts, but this hobby slowly morphed into my interest in wanting to know more about web development and what I can do with it. </li></ul>

  <p><b>This is random but, are there any hidden talents you have that can be useful in the future?</b></p>
  <ul><li>Not sure if it's hidden, but I learned Japanese for a year. Even if it's at the beginners level, It may come in handy one day. <b>そうですか?</b>~</li></ul>

  <p><b>Do you have any projects that you are currently working on?</b></p>
  <ul><li>Not exactly, unless this website counts? But I am thinking about creating a website where I can soley showcase my interests in writing.</li></ul>

  <p><b>Give a fun fact that people don't typically know about yourself.</b></p>
  <ul><li><u>Fun Fact</u>: I used to create youtube videos where I would create videos of tv shows, movies, pictures and edit them with Sony Vegas by adding special effects, music, and etc. I can't remember where the files went or what the youtube channel was though.</li></ul>
