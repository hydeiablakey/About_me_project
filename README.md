About Me Project
=====

This is an about me website that i've created for a project that I was assigned in my Web Dev Bootcamp.
This project was meant to create a profile about myself that features my interests. It includes a **Gallery** section of pictures that I've taken and edited, an **About Me** Section and a **FAQ**.
